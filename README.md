# A minimal setup for MacOS 
This setup adds some useful applications, tools, and terminal features to your MacBook.
I use this setup mostly for research (coding, paper writing, presentations, some admin stuff).

**IMPORTANT:** Before you run the setup script, make sure to carefully check every command and see whether you really 
want to install it on your machine. You may have some slightly different requirements than me.

To run the setup: 
```
chmod +x setup.sh
./setup.sh
```

This will install a set of brew packages and casks for you, set up iTerm2, Oh My ZSH!, and tmux.
It will also apply some templates and styles (based on my preferences). Make sure to find one that you like before 
running the `setup.sh` script.
